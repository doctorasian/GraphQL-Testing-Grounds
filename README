# GraphQL Testing Grounds

Desc

--
dependencies:
npm install @apollo/server graphql

To run, type: node index.js
The server will be ran on the URL http://localhost:4000/

You can add a person to the server with a mutation:
mutation {
    addPerson(
        name: "Your Name"
        phone: "42-5235"
        street: "Example Ave"
        city: "NewFoundLand"
        zip_code: "3421"
    ) {
        name
        phone
        address {
            city
            street
            zip_code
        }
        id
    }
}
A unique ID will be generated for every mutation using the 'uuid' library
The person is saved into the persons array using the provided parameters.

The resolver for each type is responsible for telling the Apollo server
how it should populate each field (e.g. name, phone)
